# Forecasting Hotel Room Demand

Demand forecasting is a crucial part of hotel revenue management that aims to maximize revenue by matching demand to available capacity. 

The goal of this project is to develop forecasting models that predicts future booking arrivals based on real hotel demand data. 

This project will investigate three categories of forecasting models: 
time-series models (exponential smoothing, Holt-Winters method, AR, MA, ARIMA), advance booking models, and combined models. 
Based on the comparative analysis, best forecasting models will be discussed and proposed.
